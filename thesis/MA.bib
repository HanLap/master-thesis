	abstract = {Recent years have seen the rise of a new generation of {UI} frameworks for web application development. These frameworks differ from previous generations of {JavaScript} frameworks in that they define a declarative application development model, where transitions in the state of the {UI} are managed by the framework. This potentially greatly simplifies application development, but requires the framework to implement a rendering strategy which translates changes in application state into changes in the state of the {UI}. The performance characteristics of these rendering strategies have thus far been poorly studied. In this article, we describe the rendering strategies used in the frameworks Angular, React, Vue, Svelte and Blazor, which represent some of the most influential and widely used modern web frameworks. We find significant differences in the scaling of costs in their rendering strategies with potentially equally significant practical performance implications. To verify these differences, we implement a number of benchmarks that measure the scaling of rendering costs as an application grows in complexity. The results of our benchmarks confirm that under certain circumstances, performance differences between frameworks can range up to several orders of magnitude when performing the same tasks. Furthermore, we find that the relative performance of a rendering strategy can be effectively estimated based on factors affecting the input sizes of render loops. The best performing rendering strategies are found to be ones which minimize input sizes using techniques such as compile-time optimization and reactive programming models.},

	abstract = {One of the most used tools for creating interactive, advanced, and easily maintainable websites in 2020 is the programming language {JavaScript}. Over the last decade, many front-end frameworks have been built on top of {JavaScript}, which makes creation, design, and maintenance of interactive websites easier. As of 2020, the most popular front-end {JavaScript} frameworks were, by a large margin, React and Vue, followed by Angular. A relatively new framework called Svelte was also gaining in popularity and raised developer interest. This study will evaluate the performance of these front-end {JavaScript} frameworks. The criteria for evaluation are primarily based on speed of completing certain operations related to {DOM} elements in the web browser, such as {DOM} element addition, editing, and removal. Non-technical evaluation points include differences in architecture, development experience, popularity, maturity, and availability.

To set the context for the study of these frameworks, the study begins with an outline of the history and development of {JavaScript}. Its current status and versions are also described. Surrounding technologies relevant to the study are presented, such as {DOM} and {HTML}. Following this, the key features of front-end {JavaScript} frameworks are investigated, and the development setup process for a generic framework is documented. The criteria for selecting frameworks for evaluation is presented, and the four selected front-end frameworks are then investigated and evaluated. A benchmark {JavaScript} application is described and created for each of the frameworks. With this reference application, a number of technical benchmarks are performed, where the frameworks are rated according to how well they perform various {DOM} data updates. Finally, a recommendation is made on which frameworks are best suited for use, and how the future landscape of front-end {JavaScript} frameworks is likely to develop.},

	abstract = {New ways of working such as globally distributed development or the integration of self-motivated external developers into software ecosystems will require a better and more comprehensive understanding of developers' feelings, perceptions, motivations and identification with their tasks in their respective project environments. User experience is a concept that captures how persons feel about products, systems and services. It evolved from disciplines such as interaction design and usability to a much richer scope that includes feelings, motivations, and satisfaction. Similarly, developer experience could be defined as a means for capturing how developers think and feel about their activities within their working environments, with the assumption that an improvement of the developer experience has positive impacts on characteristics such as sustained team and project performance. This article motivates the importance of developer experience, sketches related approaches from other domains, proposes a definition of developer experience that is derived from similar concepts in other domains, describes an ongoing empirical study to better understand developer experience, and finally gives an outlook on planned future research activities.},

These software artifacts can be studied and improved based on usability and User {eXperience} ({UX}) factors. In this paper, we consider programmers to be a specific case of users and analyze different elements that influence their experience in this specific context. We conducted a systematic literature review of papers published over the last ten years related to 1) the definition of the Programmer {eXperience} ({PX}); 2) the {PX}, {UX}, and usability factors regarding the programming environments, design documents, and programming codes; and 3) sets of heuristics to evaluate the software development artifacts mentioned before. We analyzed 73 articles, and the results obtained show that: 1) the important elements that influence the {PX} are the motivation of programmers and the choice of tools they use in their work, such as programming environments; 2) most of the identified studies (59\%) aimed to evaluate the influence of the {PX}, {UX}, and usability on programming environments; 3) the majority of the studies (70\%) used methods such as usability tests and/or heuristic evaluation methods; and 4) four sets of heuristics are used to evaluate software development artifacts in relation to programming environments, programming languages, and application programming interfaces. The results suggest that further research in this area is necessary to better understand and evaluate the concept of the {PX}.},

In literature, ways to measure or control programming experience vary. Often, researchers neglect it or do not specify how they controlled it. We set out to find a well-defined understanding of programming experience and a way to measure it. From published comprehension experiments, we extracted questions that assess programming experience. In a controlled experiment, we compare the answers of 128 students to these questions with their performance in solving program-comprehension tasks. We found that self estimation seems to be a reliable way to measure programming experience. Furthermore, we applied exploratory factor analysis to extract a model of programming experience. With our analysis, we initiate a path toward measuring programming experience with a valid and reliable tool, so that we can control its influence on program comprehension.},

	shorttitle = {Have Single-Page Apps Ruined the Web?},
	abstract = {The backlash to modern front end development is gaining steam, with good reason: single-page apps have ruined the web. Can we rescue it without going backwards? In this talk, Rich Harris presents a way to do just that. Rich Harris is a graphics editor at the New York Times, where he builds {JavaScript} apps to help explain the news. He is also the creator of Rollup, the {JavaScript} module bundler, and Svelte, the front end framework.

What’s wrong with Single-Page apps? There are a lot of critiques. A non-exhaustive list of terrible things about single-page apps include: 
You’ll need a bloated {JavaScript} framework and performance will suffer
It comes with complex tooling and is less resilient, since it won’t work without {JavaScript} 
It will be buggy and accessibility issues

{JavaScript} failing is a fact of life. So what’s a developer to do? {SPAs} solve problems to the traditional approach, but are still problematic. Rich presents a new framework for thinking about how we can get the best of both the {MPA} and {SPA} worlds: transitional apps. 

What’s a transitional app? Transitional apps samples elements from both traditional and modern architecture. The term is borrowed from interior design’s framing of “transitional design.” Transitional apps are, like multi-page apps, server-side rendered for fast initial loads, resilient since they work without {JS} by default, and provide a consistent experience with accessibility features built in. But like a single-page application, they also have a single codebase, fast navigation, persistent elements, and client-side state management. 

Learn more about transitional apps, and how to get the best of both worlds in Rich’s talk.
