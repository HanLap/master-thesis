\section{Experience}

\subsection{Cases where Svelte is great}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Concise / Intuitive Syntax
    \item reduction of client-server waterfalls
    \item SPA/SSR/SSG with single framework
    \item clear data flow (load function $\rightarrow$ svelte, svelte $\rightarrow$ action)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cases where Svelte is bad}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Centralized load function (compared to RSC's, load where needed)
    \item Things Which require node.js server (e.g. cron, websockets)
    \item Big data sets, which need to be shared between routes (virtuelle-fabrik)
    \item Style is scoped per default, thus it is annoying to pass classes to child component (improved with tailwind, because everything is global)
    \item Differences between client renderer and server renderer
    \item No best practices yet
    \item Problems with Svelte's Custom fetch
\end{itemize}
