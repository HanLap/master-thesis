Because of Svelte's relative novelty, not much scientific work has been published about the language. Nonetheless, we found two works comparing Svelte to other contemporary JavaScript frameworks.

\section{Angular and Svelte Frameworks: a Comparative Analysis}

\section{DOM benchmark comparison of the front-end JavaScript frameworks React, Angular, Vue, and Svelte}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Levlin\cite{levlin_dom_2020}
    \item comparative performance analysis between, React, Angular, Vue, Svelte.
    \item Performance key takeaway. React, Vue and Angular, Svelte, behave similar because of (not) using virtual DOM.
    \item React winner for mass updates, svelte winner for single updates
    \item BUT, benchmark for mass updates seem disingenuous, because Svelte benchmark does not use Svelte feature and instead directly manipulates DOM. 
\end{itemize}

\section{State of JavaScript}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{noauthor_state_nodate}
